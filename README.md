# Cpp_Introduction_To_Pointers
### Tasks
2. Create function which takes two pointers and returns pointer to a lesser number.
3. Given array of integers, initialize and print it via pointers.
4. Create array of 10 integers. Initialize array randomly within *-25 to 35* range. Get **sum** of the elements using pointer to the array.
5. Create array of 10 integers. Initialize array randomly within *-44 to 76* range. Get **product** of the elements using pointer to the array.
6. Create app which contains function which takes pointers to two arrays(A and B) and arrays sizes.
   App checks if array B is a subarray of array A and returns pointer to the *start of found segment**,
	 returns 0 if no such element.
7. Create function which takes pointer to an array and its size. Function deletes all prime numbers and returns pointer to the new array.
8. Create function which gets min array element and returns pointer to it. Use **selection sort**.
